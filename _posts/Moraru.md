 We spent some time talking to Prof. Ruxandra Moraru from the University of Waterloo, who finds beauty in having no limit on how much one can do with a given object, not being constrained by any practical question. 
  
<blockquote>
Mathematics' creativity is a way of expressing ourselves. 
    — Ruxandra Moraru
</blockquote>

During the last years Prof. Moraru learned to appreciate the importance of the physical aspects of our jobs, not only when it comes to teaching but also within the interactions seen in academics overall. 

<blockquote>
The physicality of our jobs is energizing, something that can not be replicated virtually. 
    — Ruxandra Moraru
