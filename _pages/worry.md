As decades pass, there is a critical issue that requires our attention and action before it is too late. Next time you are in a math workshop, take a moment to look around. What do you see? We are at risk of cementing a status quo that excludes many potential voices—voices that we really need if we are to thrive as a community. It had been some years since being the sole woman in a workshop - and as I reach my forties, this has an even more bitter taste than the already quite frequent sole female speaker spot. 
Inclusivity and equity shouldn’t just be ideals we sometimes think about, or we sometimes talk about; they require our active effort. This isn't just about the people in the seminar room you might be at —it extends to whom we invite and include. As organizers we sometimes do commendable attempts to include women, but very often, noticeably absent are younger women and early-career researchers.
This situation sheds light on broader issues. It's not only about who’s missing but why they're missing. It reveals the structural barriers built into how we organize and promote these events. I really think we need to move beyond merely acknowledging these issues to actively addressing them. We must challenge our assumptions, reevaluate our methods, and ensure we’re truly opening doors to everyone. As a community, we need to discuss how we can better support all potential members of our community, through mentorship, sponsorship, and practical support.
