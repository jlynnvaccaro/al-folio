This Project 365 is intended to collect one photo each day during each year, reflecting what I believe is an interesting, although possibly un-noticeable, situation - and also sometimes tiny things I hear, read or learn. You’ll find here photos of my everyday life as a mathematician (sometimes traveling around the world), as well as photos from my everyday life. If you’d like any of the photos in better resolution, email me at <a href="mailto:lauraschaposnik@gmail.com">lauraschaposnik@gmail.com</a>, and I’ll be happy to send them for non-commercial use. 

The project started in 2013, and I have now entered the 10th year of it. You can find below the links to each year's Project Website, as well as a 3 minute video compilation with music.  

See my video for 2013.
